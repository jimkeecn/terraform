# AWS Account Setup Guide

## 1. Are You Creating Resources for a Fresh AWS Account?
If **Yes**, proceed with reading the rest of this section.  
If **No** (i.e., you are creating resources for another environment), please proceed to **[Step 3: AMI Key Pair]**.

---

## Step 1: Create a New Git Branch for This Client
Create a new branch based on the `master` branch.

```sh
# Example command
git checkout -b <client_name>
```

---

## Step 2: AWS Certificate Manager
Ensure the new AWS account has the certificate `*.clients.cx` approved.
To verify if the domain is issued successfully:

1. Go to **AWS Certificate Manager**.
2. Click **List Certificates**.
3. Check if the domain name `*.clients.cx` is listed with:
   - Type: **Amazon Issued**
   - Status: **Issued**

---

## Step 3: AMI Key Pair
If you are using an existing AMI to create an EC2 instance, you may ignore this step.

Otherwise, create a Key Pair for your EC2 instance. This will allow the instance to use a new key pair for RDP access.

### Key Pair Naming Convention:
```
{Env}_UI_Key
{Env}_DB_Key
```
For example:
- **Production Environment:** `Prod_UI_Key`, `Prod_DB_Key`
- **Staging Environment:** `Staging_UI_Key`, `Staging_DB_Key`

---

## Step 4: Create a CLI User
If you already have a CLI User (IAM) with **AdministratorAccess** and **PowerUserAccess**, you may skip this step.
If you have lost the key and secret for the CLI user, create new security credentials for this user.

1. Go to **AWS IAM** â†’ **Users**.
2. Create a new user named **cli-user**.
3. Grant the following permissions:
   - `AdministratorAccess`
   - `PowerUserAccess`
4. Once created, go to **Security Credentials** for this user.
5. Create **Access Keys** for AWS CLI usage and securely store the access key and secret.

---

## Step 5: Configure AWS CLI User on Your Local Machine
First, check if you have the appropriate AWS CLI profile. Note that the profile name is customizable.

For example, if setting up a new environment for `cxiregistry`, open **PowerShell (Admin Mode)** and run:

```sh
aws configure profile=cxiregistry
```

- If key and secret are configured, proceed to the next step.
- Otherwise, set up the profile by entering the **Access Key**, **Secret Key**, and **Region**.

---

## 2. Bootstrap the Terraform for a New AWS Account
If your AWS account is **not freshly created** and Terraform has been used before, check for the following S3 bucket:
```
[client_name]-terraform-state-bucket
```
This bucket is used for securely storing the Terraform state file.

### If This is a Fresh AWS Account
1. Navigate to the **Terraform project** and open the `bootstrap` folder.
2. Edit the `var.tf` file:
   - **client_name**: Should match your AWS CLI profile name and be meaningful.
   - **client_region**: Your AWS region (e.g., `ap-southeast-2`).
3. Save the file and run the following commands in the `/bootstrap` folder:

```sh
terraform init
```
- This initializes Terraform and creates the `.terraform` directory containing required modules and plugins.

```sh
terraform plan
```
- Verify that the following three resources will be created:
  1. S3 bucket: `[client_name]-terraform-state-bucket`
  2. `aws_s3_bucket_versioning`
  3. `aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration`

If everything looks correct, apply the changes:

```sh
terraform apply
```
- This creates the **S3 bucket** on the AWS account.

4. Verify the bucket is created via **AWS Console** or **AWS CLI**.

```sh
aws s3 ls
```

---

## 3. Create Environment

### (Non-PowerShell Approach)

1. **Check for an existing environment folder:**
   - If the AWS account has been used before, an `env` folder should be present in the project root.
   - If the `env` folder exists, create a new subfolder for the environment (e.g., `dev`, `test`, `prod`, `staging`).
   - If no `env` folder exists, create it first, then add an environment subfolder.

   **Example:**
   ```
   - env/
     - prod/
   ```

2. **Copy template files:**
   - Copy all files and folders from the `template` folder to the new environment folder.

   **Example:**
   ```
   - env/
     - prod/
       - ec2/
       - iam/
       - load_balancer/
       - rest_of_folders/
       - main.tf
       - modules.tf
       - var.tf
   ```

3. **Edit `var.tf` file in the environment folder:**
   - `is_prod`: Set to `true` for production environments, otherwise `false`. (this is crusial to allow the script to know whether to include env variable inside the route53 or not. e.g cxisoftware.clients.cx or cxisoftware-stagging.clients.cx)
   - `environment`: Use one of `Dev`, `Test`, `Prod`, `Staging`, or `Sandbox` (must match camel case format).
   - `client_name`: Set to the client name (e.g., `cxi`, `primevalue`). This is used for Route 53 URLs and resource naming.
   - `client_force_url`: Specify a custom URL if required; otherwise, leave blank.
   - `client_region`: Set to a valid AWS region (e.g., `ap-southeast-2`).
   - `certificate_arn`: Provide the ARN for `*.clients.cx`.
   - `ui_ami_id`: Set to a shared UI AMI or a preset AWS AMI. If using a fresh AMI, ensure `ui_key` is configured.
   - `db_ami_id`: Set to a shared DB AMI or a preset AWS AMI. If using a fresh AMI, ensure `db_key` is configured.
   - `ui_key`: If a new UI key pair is required, provide a valid key pair name; otherwise, EC2 creation will **fail**.
   - `db_key`: If a new DB key pair is required, provide a valid key pair name; otherwise, EC2 creation will **fail**.
   - `ssl_policy`: Set a valid SSL policy for the load balancer (e.g., `ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS13-1-2-2021-06`).

4. **Edit `main.tf` to configure the S3 backend:**
   Locate the `backend "s3"` block and replace placeholders with actual values:

   **Original:**
   ```
   backend "s3" {
         bucket         = "[bucket-client-name]-terraform-state-bucket"
         key            = "[bucket-env]/terraform.tfstate"
         region         = "[bucket-region]"
         encrypt        = true
         use_lockfile   = true
         profile        = "[bucket-client-name]"
   }
   ```

   **Updated Example:**
   ```
   backend "s3" {
         bucket         = "cxisoftware-terraform-state-bucket"
         key            = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
         region         = "ap-southeast-2"
         encrypt        = true
         use_lockfile   = true
         profile        = "cxisoftware"
   }
   ```

5. **Initialize Terraform inside the environment folder:**
   Open PowerShell in `env/[environment]/` and run:
   ```sh
   terraform init
   ```
   - Validates Terraform code:
   ```sh
   terraform validate
   ```
   - Runs a dry-run check before applying changes:
   ```sh
   terraform plan
   ```
   - Verify that **60 AWS resources** will be created and check:
     - Route 53 URL correctness.
     - EC2 instance creation.
     - IAM role creation.
     - S3 bucket existence.
     - Load balancer targeting the correct group.

6. **Apply the Terraform configuration:**
   ```sh
   terraform apply
   ```
   - Wait for completion.
   - Verify all AWS resources in the AWS Console.

---

### (PowerShell Approach)
1. Navigate to the **main folder** where `env-setup.ps1` is located.
2. Run the script to ensure **AWS CLI** and **Terraform** are installed:

```sh
.\env-setup.ps1
```
3. Follow the script instructions:
   - Enter the **client name** (must be in lowercase, otherwise it will be converted automatically).

---

## Notes:
- Ensure your AWS CLI is configured correctly before running Terraform.
- The Terraform bootstrap process should always be run inside the `/bootstrap` directory to avoid conflicts with other scripts.
- Store AWS credentials securely and avoid sharing them.

### Rest are old explaination, will be removed and re-organized.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<h1>Do this before everything!!!</h1>
Make sure the new AWS account has certification '*.clients.cx' approved.
to check if you have the domain issued successfully.
- go to aws certificate manager
- check List certificates
- do you have domain name as "*.clients.cx" type as "Amazon Issued" and status is "Issued"

After the certificate is successfully issued in the new AWS Account.
Replace all "##certificate_arn##" to the exact arn in the main.tf file.
If the ARN is not properly replaced, it will throw an error saying the arn is invalid when 'terraform plan'


<h1>Create Backend.tfvars file</h1>
bucket         = "[bucket-name]" //this bucket is created within the bootstrap file. usally is the "[$clientName]-terraform-state-bucket". after bootstrap, check the bucketname to fill this field.
key            = "prod/terraform.tfstate" //Make sure this key [env]/terraform.tfstate e.g prod/terraform.tfstate | test/terraform.tfstate | dev/terraform.tfstate | staging/terraform.tfstate | sandbox/terraform.tfstate
region         = "ap-southeast-2" //match the s3 region.
encrypt        = true
use_lockfile   = true

Then run the following code in the specific env folder.
terraform init -backend-config=backend.tfvars


<h1>Must Read Before Running Terraform Script</h1>

Please make sure do the following before running the script.

1. Make sure to Add the new AWS Account Global ID to the AMI that we use in this script 
if you are using for new AWS Account or cross AWS Account or cross AWS Account
2. Make sure create two key pairs one for UI and one for Database and make sure the pem file is properly stored.
3. apply all the key pairds and AMI to the ec2 script.
4. Make sure to change all Client Name inside the route53.tf file to client's Name


<h1>Naming Rules</h1>
Resource Name : env + variableName e.g prod_vpc_root
Tag Name: Env_ + variableName e.g Prod_VPCRoot

<b>VPC</b>

prod_vpc_root

<b>Subnet</b>

prod_public_subnet
prod_private_subnet
prod_dummy_subnet


<b>Internet Gateway (igw)</b>
prod_igw_public


<b>S3 </b>
//S3 bucket Name needs to be unique. so we use clientName + env + variableName
microfin-prod-crs
microfin-prod-fatca
microfin-prod-up
etc...
//However the variable output name will be using underscore instead of hypen. e.g microfin_prod_crs

<b>TargetGroup</b>
//Since target group can only use alhabetic. so it will be CamelCase in env+protocal+TG
e.g
ProdHttpTG //[Prod] as short for Production [Http] as protocal [TG] short for TargetGroup
ProdHttpsTG //[Prod] as short for Production [Https] as protocal [TG] short for TargetGroup
